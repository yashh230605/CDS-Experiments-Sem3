#EXP 1:-
Aim:- To learn how to install VS Code on your system qand run a code showig "Hello World"
Theory:-s
tep 1: Install Visual Studio Code
Download VS Code:
Go to the Visual Studio Code website.
Click on the download button that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Install VS Code:

macOS: Open the downloaded .dmg file, drag and drop the VS Code icon into the Applications folder.

You need a C++ compiler to compile and run your C++ programs. The most common compiler is GCC.
macOS:

Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
Open a terminal and run: xcode-select --install.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Linux:

Install GCC:
Open a terminal and run: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install build-essential (for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu).
Step 3: Set Up C++ Extension in VS Code
Open VS Code.
Install the C++ Extension:
Click on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for "C++".
Install the extension named "C/C++" by Microsoft.
Step 4: Write and Run "Hello World" Program
Open a New File:
Go to File -> New File.
Save the file with a .cpp extension, e.g., hello.cpp.
Write the C++ Code:
Copy and paste the following code into hello.cpp:

#EXP:-2
Aim:- To do algebric functions like addition, multiplication, subtraction and division in C++
Theory:-
In C++, you declare variables to store data. For basic arithmetic operations, you usually use int for integers or double for floating-point numbers.

Basic Arithmetic Operators
Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides one number by another. For integer division, the result is an integer. For floating-point division, the result is a floating-point number.

#Exp:-3
Aim:- To use logical operators like assignment, comparision and arithmatic operators in C++
Theory:-
1. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

= : Assigns the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable.
2. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
< : Less than
> : Greater than

3. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulus (remainder of the division)

#Exp:-4
Aim:- To learn how to use Bitwise operator in C++
Theory:-
Bitwise AND (&)
Description: Performs a bitwise AND operation between two integers. The result has bits set to 1 where both corresponding bits of the operands are 1.

Bitwise OR (|)
Description: Performs a bitwise OR operation between two integers. The result has bits set to 1 where at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.
Example:

Bitwise XOR (^)
Description: Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two integers. The result has bits set to 1 where the corresponding bits of the operands are different.

Bitwise NOT (~)
Description: Performs a bitwise NOT operation, which inverts all the bits of the operand. Itâ€™s also known as the bitwise complement.

Bitwise Left Shift (<<)
Description: Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand. New bits introduced on the right are set to 0.

Bitwise Right Shift (>>)
Description: Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand. For signed integers, the sign bit is used for the new bits introduced on the left.
